# React Front-end development

> This is the main repository for all the React related material

## System Requirements

Before starting please make sure that you have successfully installed the below dependencies on your development environment.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. We will use the latest LTS version.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - is the official Nodejs Package Manager (npm) which allows us to manage our dependencies and packages. It is automatically installed with nodejs, so you don't have to install it separately.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) / [github account](https://github.com/) - is a version control system for source code and Github is a community site that allows easy creation and collaboration on git projects.

## Verifying installation

After installing node please verify that you have setup everything correctly by typing the below commands on your terminal:

- `node -v` ➡️ `v12.17.0` (any version >= 12 is fine, in my case the version is specifically v12.17.0)
- `npm -v` ➡️ `6.14.4` (any version >= 6 is fine, in my case the version is specifically 6.14.4)

## Code editor

Feel free to use any text editor / IDE you like. I personally recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) since it is light-weight, has a tone of extensions / plugins and it is an industry standard. I'll be using VS Code with the below extensions:

- [Babel JavaScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgmcdermott.vscode-language-babel)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [npm Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.npm-intellisense)
- [Path Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ionutvmi.path-autocomplete)
- [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)
- [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
