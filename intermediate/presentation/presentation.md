# Rules

Feel free to interrupt me for:

- questions
- relevant comments

---

# Create react app

Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

---

# Create react app

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

---

# Create react app

Files and directory structure (demo).

---

# Hooks

Let you put state and logic to your functional components!

---

# Hook rules

- only call hooks from React function components
- only call hooks at the top level
- don’t call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
- custom hooks start with useSomething PascalCase function

---

# React Hooks

- useState
- useEffect
- useReducer
- useContext
- useCallback
- useMemo
- useRef

---

# React Hooks

- useState: is used to declare a state variable and can be initialized with any type of value. It returns an array with the (current) state and a function used to update the state.
- useReducer: An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method.

---

# React Hooks

- useEffect: accepts an effect "action" as an anonymous function as the first argument. Skip applying an effect if certain values haven’t changed between re-renders. To do so, pass an array as an optional second argument to useEffect. Finally, some effects might require cleanup so they return a function.
- useCallback: useCallback will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the inputs has changed.

---

# React Hooks

- useMemo: Returns a memoized value. Pass a “create" function and an array of inputs. useMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the inputs has changed.
- useRef: useRef returns a mutable ref object whose ".current" property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

---

# How do lifecycle methods correspond to Hooks?

- constructor: function components don’t need a constructor. You can initialize the state in the useState call
- getDerivedStateFromProps: schedule an update while rendering instead
- shouldComponentUpdate: React.memo
- render: this is the function component body itself

---

# How do lifecycle methods correspond to Hooks?

- componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount: useEffect Hook
- componentDidCatch and getDerivedStateFromError: there are no Hook equivalents for these methods yet, but they will be added soon

---

# useState

```jsx
const [state, steState] = useState("my value");
```

---

# useEffect

```jsx
// accepts two arguments: a function, and dependency array
useEffect(() => {
  // do stuff
  return () => {}; // run this return function when component unmounts
}, []); // dependency array
```

---

# useReducer

```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

---

# Hooks

Examples.

---

# Forms and Events

- inputs events
- form events

---

# Components and events

- SyntheticEvent
- cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event
- it has the same interface as the browser’s native event, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault()
- you have access to the native event using event.nativeEvent

---

# Components and events

- react events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase
- [supported events](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events)

---

# Forms and Events

Examples.

---

# Custom hooks

Custom hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic (such as setting up a subscription and remembering the current value), but every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated.

---

# Custom hooks

- reuse stateful logic between components
- simplify components (easy to understand)
- share logic between different components and lifecycle methods
- easier and more flexible pattern from render props and higher-order components

---

# Custom hooks rules

- only call hooks from React function components
- only call hooks at the top level
- don’t call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
- custom hooks start with useSomething PascalCase function

---

# Custom hooks

Examples.

---

# Custom hooks

(./src/examples/custom-hooks/exercise/UserCard.js)

1. create a custom "useUser" custom hook
2. keep the same functionality
3. use the custom hook to get the user data on the UserCard component

---

# Mini project: ToDo list

Starting point (./intermediate/workshop/todo-app).

---

# Mini project: exercise 1

Create the add todo functionality.

---

# Mini project: exercise 2

Create the toggle todo functionality.

---

# Mini project: exercise 3

Create the delete todo functionality.

---

# Mini project: exercise 4

Replace the hard-coded todos with server data, using this [endpoint](https://api.npoint.io/046043e533a374a3388d).
